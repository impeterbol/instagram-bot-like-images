This is useful to like pictures from the instagram account. 


# Installation:

3. Click on the picture to open it in the full view. In this view you will have two navigation arrows (prev / next image), photo, like&Comment section; Your url might look like instagram.com/p/some_text
4. Open console
5. Paste the whole code from the repo to the console, press enter to start liking
6. Capture the clearInterval code to stop the liking proceed using clearInterval(_given_code_);
7. Once the bot goes till the end of the profile it will start providing Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'click' of null at <anonymous>: - now you're fine clearing the Interval
